# Bluetooth-Disruptor üí•

A powerful Python-based tool designed for conducting **Bluetooth Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks**. This utility aims to disrupt existing Bluetooth connections to a target device (like a smart speaker) by overwhelming it with connection requests, potentially allowing you to establish a new connection.

## üåü Features

* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both **Full Linux distributions** (e.g., Kali Linux, Ubuntu) and **Termux on Android**.
* **Intuitive Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Easy-to-use arguments for flexible operation.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Designed for stable execution with proper error management.
* **Advanced Device Scanning:** Discover nearby Bluetooth devices with detailed information.
* **Configurable DoS Parameters:** Adjust attack intensity with customizable attempts and delays.
* **Verbose Output:** Get detailed real-time feedback on the attack progress.
